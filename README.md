## Intro to Python

Welcome! This couse has been designed to serve as a student's first introduction to programming. We will be using the popular programming language that is simple to understand and use. We will cover the very basics of computer programming and build up tools and techniques until we get to work with recursion, a powerful method for creating powerful programs.

The syllabus will be updated and published here soon.
