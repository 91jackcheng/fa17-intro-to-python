# Exercise 1
# Simultaneous assignments
# Prompt the user to enter three numbers
number1, number2, number3 = eval(input("Enter three numbers: "))
# Compute average
average = (number1 + number2 + number3) / 3
# Display result
print("The average of", number1, number2, number3, "is", average)


# Exercise 2
# You can import the math module and use various functions
import math #imports the module
print(math.pi)
print(math.cos(math.pi))
# Now print out what 1.57 radians is in degrees (the function is degrees())
print(math.degrees(1.57))
# Print the square root of 2025 (sqrt())
print(math.sqrt(2025))
# What about the log of 80? (log(x, base))
print(math.log(80, 10))
# default for log is base e- math.e


# Exercise 3
# You can print something with a specific ending and it won't automatically go to the next line
print("Python", end=" is cool")
print("This will be on the same line")
# Now make it so that the following is all on the same line and separated by an asterisk 
# Like this: This prints*out without*a new line
print("This prints", end=" ")
print("out without", end=" ")
print("a new line")

print("Skip", end=" ") # new line
print()
print("lines")



# Exercise 4
# Ask user to enter a weight in kilograms and convert it to pounds
weightKG = eval(input("Enter the weight: "))

# conversion (1 lb = 0.454 kg)
weightLBS = weightKG/0.454 
print("The weight in pounds is: ", weightLBS, "lbs")
